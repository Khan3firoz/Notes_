There are various tools and methodologies that can aid you in adapting newer code to function with older browsers. Your optimal approach depends on the particular technologies utilized in your project and the specific older browsers you need to support. Here are some commonly employed strategies:

**1. Transpilers:**

Transpilers are beneficial tools that translate modern code syntax into formats that can be interpreted by older browsers. Some widely used transpilers include:
- **Babel:** Babel is a renowned JavaScript transpiler that supports an extensive range of features. It provides the flexibility to target specific browser versions for ensuring compatibility.
- **TypeScript:** While TypeScript's principal function is as a typing language, it can also be transpiled into JavaScript that is compatible with older browsers.
- **Traceur:** Traceur is another JavaScript transpiler that is specifically designed to target older versions of Internet Explorer.
  
  **2. Polyfills:**
  
  Polyfills are libraries that emulate modern browser features in older browsers. This allows developers to use newer APIs without having to worry about compatibility issues. Some of the popular polyfills include:
- **[Polyfill.io](http://polyfill.io/):** This service provides a comprehensive set of polyfills for a variety of browser features.
- **Can I Use?:** This website provides information on browser support for different features and also offers links to the corresponding polyfills.
  
  **3. Feature Detection and Conditional Rendering:**
  
  This technique involves checking for browser capabilities using feature detection and then conditionally rendering different code based on these results. This approach may require more manual work but it can provide a finer level of control over compatibility.
  
  **4. Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**
  
  In certain situations, you can render your modern code on the server and then send the pre-rendered HTML to older browsers. This bypasses the need for client-side compatibility considerations. However, this method adds an additional layer of complexity and may not be suitable for all applications.
  
  **Additional Tips:**
- **Identify your target browsers:** It's crucial to determine which specific browsers you need to support. This will guide you in choosing the appropriate tools and techniques.
- **Use a build tool:** Build tools like Webpack and Gulp can automate the transpilation and polyfilling process for your project, saving you time and effort.
- **Test thoroughly:** It's essential to always test your code on different browsers to ensure compatibility. This will help you catch any potential issues early and make necessary adjustments.
  
  Always remember that there's no universal solution that will fit all scenarios. The best approach will largely depend on your specific needs and project requirements.
