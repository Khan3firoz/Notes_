- Angular templates are the blueprints that define the visual structure and presentation of your application's components. They are written in HTML-like syntax with special directives and expressions that allow you to dynamically display data and respond to user interactions.

- **Key Characteristics of Angular Templates:**
	- **HTML-like syntax:**  Templates resemble HTML, making them familiar to web developers.  They include elements, attributes, and text content to define the UI structure.
	- **Angular Directives:**  Special attributes prefixed with `*` or `ng` instruct Angular to process the template elements in specific ways. These directives extend the capabilities of HTML and provide dynamic behavior.
	- **Data Binding:**  Angular's data binding syntax (`{{ }}`) allows you to embed expressions within the template that display component properties or perform calculations. This creates a link between the component's data and the view, keeping them synchronized.
	- **Interpolation:**  The simplest form of data binding, interpolation (`{{ }}`) displays the value of an expression directly within the template content.  For example, `<h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>` would display a greeting with the value of the `name` property from the component.
	- **Property Binding:**  Used to set property values of DOM elements based on component data.  For example, `[disabled]="isButtonDisabled"` would disable a button element if the `isButtonDisabled` property in the component is true.
	- **Event Binding:**  Allows you to listen for user events on DOM elements and execute component methods in response.  For example, `(click)="onClick($event)"` would call the `onClick` method in the component when the user clicks the element.

- **Benefits of Using Angular Templates:**
	- **Declarative Approach:**  Templates describe the desired view state, and Angular handles the underlying logic, promoting a clean separation of concerns.
	- **Dynamic UI:**  Data binding and directives enable templates to dynamically update based on changes in component data or user interactions.
	- **Reusability:**  Templates can be reused across components with minimal modification, improving code efficiency.
