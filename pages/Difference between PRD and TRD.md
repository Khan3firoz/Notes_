- ## Product Requirements Document (PRD)
  heading:: 2
	- A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a comprehensive document that outlines the product's purpose, features, functionalities, and behavior. It serves as a guide for what the product should do and aims to align the development team, stakeholders, and other involved parties on the product vision and requirements.
	- ### Key Components
	  heading:: 3
		- **Overview:** Describes the product vision, objectives, and scope.
		- **User Stories/Use Cases:** Detailed scenarios depicting how different users will interact with the product.
		- **Features and Requirements:** List of features and detailed requirements that the product must fulfill.
		- **User Interface (UI) Requirements:** Mockups, wireframes, or descriptions of the UI elements and interactions.
		- **Non-functional Requirements:** Performance, scalability, usability, and other non-functional aspects.
		- **Acceptance Criteria:** Conditions under which the product will be considered complete and successful.
		- **Dependencies:** External systems, tools, or libraries the product relies on.
		- **Timeline:** High-level timeline for development milestones and delivery.
	- ### Purpose

- ## Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
  heading:: 2
- A Technical Requirements Document (TRD) is a detailed document that outlines the technical aspects and specifications necessary to implement the product described in the PRD. It focuses on the technical implementation and provides a roadmap for the engineering team on how to build the product.
- ### Key Components
  heading:: 3
	- **Architecture Overview:** High-level architecture of the system, including diagrams and descriptions of major components.
	- **Technical Specifications:** Detailed technical requirements and specifications for each component of the system.
	- **Data Models:** Data structures, database schemas, and data flow diagrams.
	- **APIs and Interfaces:** Descriptions of APIs, protocols, and interfaces the system will use or provide.
	- **Security Requirements:** Details on security measures, encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
	- **Performance Requirements:** Specific performance benchmarks and metrics the system must achieve.
	- **Development Environment:** Tools, technologies, frameworks, and platforms required for development.
	- **Integration Requirements:** Integration points with other systems and services, along with data exchange formats.
	- **Testing and Validation:** Technical criteria and methods for testing and validating the system.
	- **Deployment and Maintenance:** Procedures for deploying, configuring, and maintaining the system.
- ### Purpose
  heading:: 3
  The TRD provides a detailed technical blueprint for building the product. It ensures that the engineering team understands the technical requirements and has a clear plan for implementation, testing, and deployment.

  | Aspect              | PRD                                           | TRD                                            |
  |---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
  | **Focus**           | Product features and user requirements        | Technical implementation and specifications    |
  | **Purpose**         | Define what the product should do             | Define how the product should be built         |
  | **Audience**        | Product managers, stakeholders, dev teams     | Engineering teams, system architects, DevOps   |
  | **Key Components**  | Vision, user stories, features, UI, acceptance criteria | Architecture, technical specs, APIs, security, performance |
  | **Level of Detail** | High-level product requirements               | Detailed technical specifications              |
  
  Understanding the distinction between PRD and TRD is crucial for ensuring that a product is well-defined from both a business and a technical perspective, leading to successful development and deployment.
