**NPM** stands for "Node Package Manager." It is a package manager for JavaScript and the default package manager for Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on the V8 JavaScript engine.

**NPM** is used to manage and share packages (libraries, tools, and frameworks) written in JavaScript. It allows developers to easily:
- Install, update, and manage project dependencies.
- Publish and share their own packages via a central registry.
  
  Key features of **NPM** include:
- Package Management: Simplifies the process of installing, updating, and removing packages in a Node.js project. Developers can declare project dependencies in a package.json file, and **NPM** will handle the installation of those dependencies.
- Dependency Resolution: Automatically resolves and installs the dependencies required by a project, making it easy to manage complex dependency trees.
- Versioning: Uses semantic versioning (SemVer) to manage package versions, allowing developers to specify version ranges in their project's package.json file.
- Scripting: Allows developers to define and run custom scripts in the package.json file. Common scripts include tasks for building, testing, and running applications.
- Global and Local Installation: Can install packages globally, making them accessible from the command line, or locally, scoped to a specific project.
  
  To use **NPM**, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine, as **NPM** is bundled with Node.js. Once installed, you can interact with **NPM** through the command line by running commands like
