**Parcel** and **Webpack** are both popular JavaScript bundlers. They are tools that help developers manage and bundle various assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, images, and more, into a format that is optimized for deployment in a web browser.

**Why do we need bundlers like Parcel or Webpack?**
- Module System: JavaScript applications are often developed using a modular approach, with code split into multiple files or modules. Bundlers help manage these modules and package them into a format that browsers can efficiently load.
- Dependency Management: Bundlers handle dependency resolution, ensuring that dependencies are loaded in the correct order. This is crucial for larger applications with complex dependency trees.
- Optimization: Bundlers can optimize code by minimizing, uglifying, and compressing it. This reduces the size of the files that need to be transferred over the network, improving page load times.
- Asset Handling: Bundlers can process and bundle various types of assets, such as stylesheets, images, fonts, and more, making it easier to manage and optimize the entire project.
- Code Splitting: Bundlers like Webpack support code splitting, allowing developers to split the code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand, improving application performance.
