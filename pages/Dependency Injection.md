- Dependency injection (DI) is a fundamental design pattern in Angular that promotes loose coupling and simplifies the process of providing external dependencies to components, services, and other parts of your application.
-
- **Understanding Dependency Injection in Angular:**
	- **Core Principle:**  Components and services don't create their own dependencies directly. Instead, they declare the dependencies they need, and Angular injects those dependencies at runtime.
	- **Benefits:**
		- **Loose Coupling:**  Components and services rely on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations, making them more flexible and easier to test.
		- **Testability:**  You can easily mock dependencies during testing, isolating the component or service under test.
		- **Maintainability:**  Changes to dependencies are centralized, reducing the impact on dependent components.
		- **Code Reusability:**  Reusable components and services can be easily injected into different parts of the application.

- ```javascript
  // DataService (dependency)
  @Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root'
  })
  export class DataService {
    // ... service logic
  }
  
  // UserService (component that depends on DataService)
  @Component({
    selector: 'app-user',
    templateUrl: './user.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./user.component.css']
  })
  export class UserComponent {
    constructor(private dataService: DataService) {} // Injecting DataService
  
    ngOnInit() {
      this.dataService.getUserData(1).subscribe(user => {
        // Use the user data
      });
    }
  }
  
  ```
- ```
  In this example, the UserService component injects the DataService dependency. The @Injectable decorator on DataService specifies that it's a service and how it's provided (providedIn: 'root' makes it a singleton). The UserService constructor injects the DataService using constructor injection syntax, and Angular provides the appropriate instance based on the registered provider.
