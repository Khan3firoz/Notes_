React elements and React components are both fundamental building blocks in React, but they serve different purposes:

|  | React Element | React Component |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | A lightweight object describing what should be rendered on the screen. It's like a blueprint for a DOM node. | A reusable piece of code encapsulating UI logic and state. It defines how an element or a group of elements should be rendered. |
| Structure | An element consists of a type (e.g., div, h1), optional props (attributes passed to the element), and optional children (nested elements). | Can be a function component (declarative) or a class component (stateful). Both return React elements. |
| Creation | Created using JSX syntax or React.createElement() function. | Built using JavaScript functions or classes. |
| Immutable | Once created, an element cannot be changed. If data changes, a new element needs to be created. | Can be updated and reused multiple times with different props, leading to maintainable and modular code. |
| Example | <div className="title">Hello World</div> | A JavaScript function or class that returns a React element. |
| State Management | Does not manage state. | Can manage its own internal state using hooks or class methods, allowing for dynamic updates. |
| Lifecycle Methods | Does not have lifecycle methods. | Can have lifecycle methods like componentDidMount to perform actions at different stages of its existence. |
