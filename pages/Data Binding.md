- Data binding is a fundamental concept in Angular that creates a dynamic link between a component's data (properties) and the view (template). It ensures that the UI reflects the current state of the data and that user interactions with the UI can update the data in the component. Angular provides several data binding mechanisms to achieve different levels of data synchronization:
	- **String Interpolation ({{ }}):**
		- **Description:** The simplest form of data binding. Displays the value of an expression directly within the template content.
		- ```htmlmixed
		  <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
		  ```
	-
	- **Property Binding ([...]):**
		- Property Binding ([...]):**
		- **Description:** Sets the value of a property on a DOM element based on a component property or expression.
		- ```htmlembedded
		  <button [disabled]="isButtonDisabled">Click me</button>
		  ```
-
	- ** [[Event Binding]] (()):**
		- **Description:** Listens for user events on DOM elements and executes component methods in response.
		- ```htmlmixed
		  <button (click)="onClick($event)">Click me</button>
		  
		  ```
-
	- ** Two-way Data Binding ([( )]:)**
		- **Description:** A shorthand for both property binding and event binding, often used for form elements. Creates a two-way communication channel between the component property and the DOM element's value.
		- ```htmlembedded
		  <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">
		  ```
- **Attribute Binding (attr.[attribute-name]):**
	- **Description:**  Sets the value of an attribute on a DOM element based on a component property or expression. This is useful for setting attributes that don't have a corresponding property on the DOM element itself.
	- ```htmlembedded
	  <img [attr.src]="imageUrl" alt="Image">
	  ```
-
- **Class Binding ([class.class-name]):**
	- **Description:**  Toggles a CSS class on a DOM element based on a boolean expression.
	- ```htmlembedded
	  <h1 [class.highlight]="isImportant">This is a heading</h1>
	  ```
- **Style Binding ([style.style-name]):**
	- **Description:**  Sets the value of a specific style property on a DOM element based on a component property or expression.
	- ```htmlembedded
	  <h1 [style.color]="getTextColor()">This is a heading</h1>
	  ```
