- An empathy map is a collaborative visualization used to articulate what we know about a particular type of user. It helps to create a shared understanding of user needs and aids in decision-making processes. Typically, an empathy map is divided into several quadrants, each representing different aspects of the user's experience and perspective.
-
- Here's a structure for creating an empathy map:
- ### 1.  **Quadrants of an Empathy Map:**
	- #### a.  **Says:**
		- What the user says out loud in an interview or during usability testing.
		- Quotes from the user.
		- Example: "I find it difficult to navigate through the app."
	- #### b.  **Thinks:**
		- What the user is thinking throughout the experience.
		- Often inferred from what they say or do.
		- Example: "I wish there was a search function here."
	- #### c.  **Does:**
		- The actions the user takes.
		- Behaviors and activities observed.
		- Example: Frequently clicking on the help button.
	- #### d.  **Feels:**
		- The emotions the user experiences.
		- How the user feels about the experiences.
		- Example: Frustrated when the app crashes.
- ### 2.  **Additional Considerations:**
	- #### a.  **Pains:**
		- Challenges and pain points the user faces.
		- Obstacles that prevent them from achieving their goals.
		- Example: "It's hard to find the settings page."
	- #### b.  **Gains:**
		- The benefits the user gains.
		- The positive outcomes they seek or achieve.
		- Example: "When the app works, it saves me a lot of time."
