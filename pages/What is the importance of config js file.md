**In React Applications:**
- **Environment Configurations:** Set API base URLs, logging levels, or feature flags according to the environment. Use `dotenv` or Next.js.
- **Global Styles:** Store theme colors, fonts, and styling parameters. Consider Styled Components or Emotion for component styling.
- **Default Props:** Define defaults for reusable components. Use TypeScript's `defaultProps`.
- **Data and Content:** Store static data or content in `config.js`. For large data, use database or API solutions.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** Manage API keys, tokens, or credentials. Use environment variables or configuration files for sensitive information.
  
  **In Web Development:**
- **Build-Tool Configurations:** Customize Webpack, Babel, or other build tools. Refer to their documentation.
- **Deployment Settings:** Customize deployment targets and commands. Use build tools or CI/CD pipelines for automation.
- **Framework/Library Settings:** Adjust options for frameworks like Express, Django, or Vue.js. Consult the framework's documentation.
  
  **Considerations:**
- **Security:** Store sensitive information securely. Avoid hardcoding in `config.js`.
- **Maintainability:** Keep `config.js` organized and commented. Consider modular configurations for large projects.
- **Alternatives:** For complex configurations, explore `dotenv`, `fig`, or platform-specific solutions.
