There are two key reasons why the callback function of `useEffect` in React cannot be directly `async`:

**1. Return type mismatch:**
- `useEffect` expects its callback function to either return nothing (undefined) or a cleanup function.
- An `async` function inherently returns a Promise, not one of the expected types. This creates a type mismatch and can lead to unexpected behavior and warnings.
  
  **2. Lack of control over execution:**
- `useEffect` is asynchronous and non-blocking. This means it schedules the effect function to run later, but doesn't wait for it to finish before continuing.
- If the callback were `async`, you wouldn't have control over when the cleanup function (returning from the callback) happens. This could lead to memory leaks or other unintended side effects.
  
  However, there are still ways to handle asynchronous operations within `useEffect`:
- **Define a separate function:** Wrap your `async` logic inside a regular function and pass it to `useEffect`. This ensures the return type is correct and you have explicit control over the cleanup function.
- **Use promises or async/await with `.then`:** Chain a `.then` call after your `async/await` code to handle the result and schedule any necessary updates within the callback.
- **Use the `useFetch` hook:** React Router provides a `useFetch` hook specifically designed for fetching data asynchronously and managing state updates.
  
  While direct `async` callbacks aren't allowed, these alternative approaches offer efficient and maintainable ways to handle asynchronous operations within `useEffect`.
