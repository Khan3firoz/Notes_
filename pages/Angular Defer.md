- #Angular
- Defer is a template syntax introduced in Angular that allows you to delay the loading of specific parts of your template until they are actually needed. This is particularly useful for optimizing initial page load performance, especially in applications with large or rarely used components.
- @defer: This decorator marks the block as a deferrable view.
  (when)="isVisible": This is a trigger that specifies a condition (in this case, a property named isVisible).
- The deferred content will only be loaded when isVisible becomes true.
	- @placeholder: This block defines content that displays while the deferred content is loading.
	- @loading: This block defines content that displays during the loading process.
	- @error: This block defines content that displays if there's an error loading the deferred content.
	- prefetch: This attribute controls when the deferred content is prefetched in the background. You can specify conditions within the prefetch attribute.
- ```htmlmixed
  Example: Lazy Loading a Component Based on Scrolling:
  
  <div class="content-above-fold">
    </div>
  
  <div @defer (when)="isScrolledDown" prefetch="scroll into view">
    <app-comments></app-comments> </div>
  
  
  ```
- Deferring content can lead to several benefits:
- Improved Initial Load Time: By deferring components that aren't immediately needed, you can significantly reduce the initial bundle size of your application, resulting in a faster initial page load.
- Enhanced User Experience: Users will perceive the application as faster as they don't have to wait for content they might not even interact with.
- Better Performance: Deferring content can also improve overall application performance, especially on low-bandwidth connections.
- ```javascript
  <div class="product-description">
    </div>
  
  <div @defer (when)="isReviewsOpen" prefetch="mouseenter">
    <h2 class="reviews-title">User Reviews</h2>
    <button (click)="toggleReviews()">Show Reviews</button>
  
    <div @placeholder>Click "Show Reviews" to load...</div>
  
    <div *ngIf="isReviewsOpen">
      <app-review [reviews]="productReviews"></app-review>
  
      <div @loading>Loading reviews...</div>
      <div @error>Error loading reviews. Please try again.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  ```
