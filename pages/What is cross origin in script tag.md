The **cross origin** attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.

Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where **CORS** comes in.
- A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
- **CORS** is used to manage cross-origin requests.
  
  **CORS** stands for **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**, and is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own domain.
  
  It defines a way of how a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.
  
  **CORS** allows servers to specify who can access the assets on the server, among many other things.
