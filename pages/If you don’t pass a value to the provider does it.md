# If you donâ€™t pass a value to the provider does it take the default value? #React

You're absolutely right! When you don't pass a value prop to a `Context.Provider` in React, **two things happen depending on the version of React you're using**:

**React versions below 16.8:**
- In these versions, **no default value is provided**, which means components that attempt to access the context using `useContext` will receive `undefined` as the value. This can lead to runtime errors if components aren't prepared to handle such cases.
  
  **React versions 16.8 and above:**
- In these versions, the `Context.Provider` itself has a **default value of undefined**. So, components still receive `undefined` when accessing the context without a value prop, but it avoids errors as it's the expected behavior.
  
  **Recommendation:**
  
  It's **always good practice to explicitly provide a value** to the `Context.Provider`, even if it's an initial empty object or null. This ensures clarity and avoids potential issues, especially when working with older React versions or collaborating with others who might not be aware of the behavior differences.
  
  Here's an example:
  
  **JavaScript**
  
  ```
  // In older React versions:
  const MyContext = React.createContext();
  
  function MyProvider() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null); // Provide an initial value
  
  // ...
  
  return (
  <MyContext.Provider value={data}>
    {/* ... */}
  </MyContext.Provider>
  );
  }
  
  // In newer React versions:
  const MyContext = React.createContext({ /* empty object as default */ });
  
  function MyProvider() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  
  // ...
  
  return (
  <MyContext.Provider value={data}>
    {/* ... */}
  </MyContext.Provider>
  );
  }
  
  ```
  
  By setting a default value, you prevent unexpected behavior and improve code clarity for yourself and others!
