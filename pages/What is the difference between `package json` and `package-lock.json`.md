**In the world of Node.js** development, **package.json** and **package-lock.json** play crucial roles in managing project dependencies. While they might seem similar, they serve distinct purposes:

1. **package.json:**
	- **Purpose:** Declares your project's metadata, dependencies, and scripts.
	- **Content:**
	  
	  Project name, description, license, author information.Lists project dependencies (libraries and tools) with desired version ranges (e.g., "^2.0.0").Defines custom scripts for tasks like build, test, run.
	- **Location:** Located in the project's root directory.
	- **Version control:** Typically committed to version control (Git, etc.).
	- **Modification:** Manually edited to add/remove dependencies, update ranges, or change scripts.
	  2. **package-lock.json:**
	- **Purpose:** Locks down the exact versions of installed dependencies and their sub-dependencies.
	- **Content:**
	  
	  Detailed tree structure of all installed dependencies and their exact versions.Hash codes for verifying integrity and reproducibility.
	- **Location:** Located in the project's root directory.
	- **Version control:** Usually not committed to version control.
	- **Modification:** Do not edit manually.It's automatically generated or updated.
