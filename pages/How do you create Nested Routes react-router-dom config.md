  Creating nested routes in React Router DOM v6 involves configuring your routes within a nested structure using the `Routes` and `Route` components. Here's a step-by-step guide:
  
  **1. Import necessary components:**
  
  **JavaScript**
  
  ```jsx
  import { Routes, Route, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
  
  ```
  
  **2. Define parent and child routes:**
  
  Imagine a basic e-commerce application with nested routes for products and their details:
  
  **JavaScript**
  
  ```jsx
  function App() {
  return (
  <Routes>
    {/* Parent route for products */}
    <Route path="/" element={<Products />}>
      {/* Nested child route for product details */}
      <Route path="products/:productId" element={<ProductDetails />} />
      {/* Outlet for rendering child routes within Products */}
      <Outlet />
    </Route>
    {/* Other routes... */}
  </Routes>
  );
  }
  
  function Products() {
  // Handle product listing logic
  return (
  // Product list view and links to product details
  <Outlet />
  );
  }
  
  function ProductDetails({ match }) {
  // Access product ID from match.params.productId
  return (
  // Product details view based on ID
  );
  }
  
  ```
  
  **Explanation:**
- The `Routes` component wraps all your routes.
- The `Route` component defines a route with a specific path and an `element` that renders the corresponding component.
- The `:productId` placeholder in the child route captures the product ID from the URL.
- The `Outlet` component acts as a placeholder within the parent route, rendering the active child route based on the URL.
