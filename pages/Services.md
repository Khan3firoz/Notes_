- Services in Angular are specialized classes that handle tasks that are shared across multiple components in your application. They promote separation of concerns, code reusability, and improved application architecture.
- Services can:
	- Manage data and share it between components.
	- Perform operations like fetching data from an API, interacting with local storage, or logging information.
	- Provide utility functions that can be used throughout the application.
- **Benefits of Using Services:**
	- **Separation of Concerns:** Services isolate application logic from components, making components more focused on UI and data presentation.
	- **Code Reusability:** Services can be injected and used by multiple components, reducing code duplication and promoting maintainability.
	- **Dependency Injection:** Angular's dependency injection system allows you to manage dependencies within services, making your code more testable and flexible.
	- **Improved Architecture:** Services help in structuring your application in a modular way, promoting better organization and scalability.
