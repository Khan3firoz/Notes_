**In web development**: **browserlist** acts as a configuration tool that helps you specify the target browsers your application should support.

This information becomes crucial during the build process, allowing tools like Babel, Autoprefixer, and PostCSS to make informed decisions about:
- Code Transpilation: Converting code from one version or language to another. Commonly used to convert modern JavaScript (ES6+) to older versions for wider browser compatibility.
- Polyfill Inclusion: Adding extra code to provide missing features in older browsers. Helps ensure that modern web features work even in browsers that don't natively support them.
- CSS Prefixing: Adding browser-specific prefixes to CSS properties to ensure consistent styling across different browsers. This ensures that CSS features work correctly across various browser implementations.
