**Advanced Features:Code Splitting:**
- Break down your application into smaller bundles, loading only the necessary code for each page, further improving initial load times.
- Lazy Loading: Load specific modules or components only when needed, further optimizing performance for complex applications.
- Caching: Leverage browser caching mechanisms for faster subsequent page loads.
- Source Maps: Generate source maps for debugging, allowing you to pinpoint errors in your original code despite the bundled output.
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Enhance SEO and initial load performance by pre-rendering content on the server before sending it to the client.
- Module Federation: Share code and functionality across multiple applications, promoting code reusability and modularity.
  
  **Developer Experience Enhancements:**
- Watchers and Live Reloading: Automatically rebuild and refresh your application upon code changes, saving you time and effort.
- Dev Servers: Serve your application locally with features like hot reloading and live debugging.
- Build Profiling: Analyze and optimize your build process, identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
- Bundler Plugins: Expand functionality with a vast ecosystem of plugins for specific tasks like image optimization, CSS preprocessors, and more.
  
  **Other Notable Superpowers:**
- Accessibility Support: Some bundlers offer tools and integrations to ensure your application meets accessibility standards.
- Security Features: Certain bundlers provide security measures like code signing and content integrity checks.
- Internationalization (i18n) Support: Facilitate localization and translation of your application content.
- Offline Support: Enable features like caching and service workers to allow your application to function even without an internet connection.
