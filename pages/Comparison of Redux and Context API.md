| Feature | Redux | Context API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Global state management | Sharing data across components |
| Complexity | More complex | Simpler to set up |
| Scalability | Well-suited for large applications | Less scalable for complex applications |
| Predictability | State updates are predictable and controlled | Updates can be less predictable |
| Debugging | Time-travel debugging with Redux DevTools | Debugging more challenging |
| Data flow | Unidirectional (actions -> reducers -> state) | Bidirectional (data changes can come from anywhere) |
| Performance | Can impact performance in very large applications | Generally performs well |
| Learning curve | Steeper learning curve due to specific concepts | Easier to learn initially |
| Suitable for | Complex applications with extensive state needs | Smaller applications or sharing specific data |
