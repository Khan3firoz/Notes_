- Directives in Angular are powerful tools that extend the capabilities of HTML elements and attributes within your application's templates. They provide a way to add custom behavior, manipulate the DOM, and modify the appearance of your components.
-
- Types of Directives:
- **Structural Directives:**
	- Alter the DOM structure (layout) by adding, removing, or manipulating elements based on conditions or loops.
	- Examples:
		- `*ngIf`: Conditionally shows or hides an element based on a boolean expression.
		- `*ngFor`: Repeats an HTML template for each item in a list or array.
		- `*ngSwitch`: Switches between alternative content sections based on a value.
- **Attribute Directives:**
	- Modify the appearance or behavior of an element by changing its attributes, styles, or classes.
	- Examples:
		- `[ngClass]`: Dynamically adds or removes CSS classes based on an expression.
		- `[ngStyle]`: Dynamically sets styles on an element based on a style object.
		- `[attr.*]`: Sets arbitrary attributes on an element based on component properties.
- **Component Directives:**
	- A special type of directive that defines a reusable component. They are essentially directives with a template associated with them using the `@Component` decorator.
- **Custom Directives:**
	- You can create your own custom directives to extend Angular's functionality and encapsulate reusable behavior.
	- A custom directive requires:
		- A TypeScript class decorated with `@Directive`.
		- Specifying the selector (element, attribute, or comment) where the directive is used.

- **Benefits of Using Directives:**
	- **Code Reusability:**  Directives promote code reusability by encapsulating common logic and behavior that can be applied across different components.
	- **DOM Manipulation:**  They provide a structured way to manipulate the DOM based on your application logic, making your templates more dynamic.
	- **Enhanced UI:**  Directives allow you to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces by responding to user interactions and data changes.
