- #Angular
- Angular projects typically have a structured file layout that serves various purposes and helps maintain consistency across development teams. Here's a breakdown of the key files and directories and their uses:
- ## .gitignore
	- Maintains consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project.
	- Standard file used by Git to identify files and folders to be ignored while committing the code.
-
- ## src/
	- Angular application starts executing from this directory.
	- Contains the source code for the Angular application, including components, services, modules, styles, and assets.
-
- ## node_modules/
	- Provides version information for all packages installed into node_modules.
	- Configures npm package dependencies that are available to all projects in the workspace.
-
- ## tsconfig.json
	- Application-specific TypeScript configuration, including TypeScript and Angular template compiler options.
-
- ## tsconfig.spec.json
	- TypeScript configuration for the application tests.
-
- ## tslint.json
	- Application-specific TSLint configuration.
	- TSLint is an extensible static analysis tool that checks TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors.
	  
	  The structured file layout in Angular projects helps in organizing code, managing dependencies, and ensuring consistency in coding standards and practices across the development team.
