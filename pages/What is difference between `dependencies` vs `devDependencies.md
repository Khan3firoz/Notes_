**In the world of Node.js packages and package.json**, **dependencies** and **devDependencies** are crucial concepts for managing what goes into your project. Here's a breakdown of their key differences:
- **dependencies:**
	- **Purpose:** Essential building blocks for your application to function. They are directly used in your code and are required for running the application in production.
	- **Location:** Installed in the node_modules directory along with your project.
	- **Included in package.json:** Listed under the "dependencies" section.
	- **Versioning:** Managed and updated through npm install or yarn install.
	- **Example:** Express web framework, database driver, utility libraries.
- **devDependencies:**
	- **Purpose:** Tools and libraries only needed for development and testing, not for production environments.
	- **Location:** Installed in the node_modules directory separate from production dependencies.
	- Included in package.json: Listed under the "devDependencies" section, delineating their role in development and testing workflows.
	- Versioning: Managed separately from production dependencies, often with specific versions optimized for development environments, via commands like npm install --save-dev or yarn add --dev.
	- Example: Encompasses testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha), build tools (e.g., Babel, webpack), and other development utilities geared towards enhancing the development process without impacting production runtime.
