**npx stands for Node Package Execute. It's a tool** included with npm that lets you run any npm package without installing it first.
- **Execute without installation:** Run packages on-demand for quick tasks or testing.
- **Avoids dependency clutter:** Keeps your project clean and reduces installation overhead.
- **Version agnostic:** Uses the latest version from the npm registry.
- **Global or local packages:** Works with both globally installed and local project dependencies.
  
  **Example:** Run create-react-app without installing
  
  **Key uses:**
- Trying out new packages
- Running build tools or scripts
- Launching development servers
- Executing commands from GitHub gists
  
  **Remember:** npx isn't ideal for packages you use regularly, as it doesn't manage versions in your project. For those, use npm install.
