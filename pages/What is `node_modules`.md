**The node_modules folder in a Node.js project contains all the dependencies your project needs to run.** These dependencies are downloaded and installed from npm (Node Package Manager) based on the specifications in your package.json file.

**Pushing node_modules to Git is generally not recommended for several reasons:**
- **1. Size and Redundancy**
- **2. Version Control Overhead**
- **3. Version Management**
- **4. Security Concerns**
