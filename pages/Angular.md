- What is Angular? #Angular
- Angular is a framework for building web applications. It helps developers create dynamic and responsive websites by providing tools and structure to manage everything from the layout to the data and user interactions.

- **Benefits:**
	- **Structured Development:**
	  Angular provides a well-defined structure for your code, making it easier to manage large projects.
	- **Two-Way Data Binding:**
	  Changes in the user interface automatically update the underlying data model and vice versa, reducing the amount of boilerplate code.
	- **Component-Based Architecture:**
	  Applications are built using reusable components, which makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.
	- **Dependency Injection:**
	  Angular's dependency injection system makes it easier to manage and test your code by allowing you to inject dependencies instead of hard-coding them.
	- **Comprehensive Ecosystem:**
	  Angular comes with a suite of tools and libraries, including built-in testing, routing, and form handling, which accelerates development.
- **Use Cases:**
	- **Single Page Applications (SPAs):**
	  Angular is ideal for SPAs where the user interacts with a single web page that dynamically updates as they interact with it.
	- **Enterprise Web Applications:**
	  Its robust structure and maintainability make Angular suitable for large-scale enterprise applications.
	- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):**
	  Angular can be used to build PWAs, which combine the best of web and mobile apps.
