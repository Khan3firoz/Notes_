In your **package.json** file, the symbols **^** (caret) and **~** (tilde) are used to specify version ranges for your project's dependencies. They control which versions of those dependencies will be considered compatible with your project. Here's a breakdown of their differences:
- **Caret (^) -** Major compatibility with minor updates
- **Tilde (~) -** Patch compatibility with minor updates
