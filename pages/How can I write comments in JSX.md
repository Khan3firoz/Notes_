There are two main ways to write comments in JSX:

**1. Single-line comments:**

Use the standard JavaScript single-line comment syntax within curly braces `{}`:

**JavaScript**

```
{ /* This is a single-line comment within JSX */ }

```

**2. Multi-line comments:**

For comments spanning multiple lines, use the traditional JavaScript multi-line comment syntax within curly braces:

**JavaScript**

```
{ /*
This is a multi-line comment
within JSX that spans multiple lines.
*/ }

```
