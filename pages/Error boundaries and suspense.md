Both error boundaries and suspense are crucial mechanisms in React for handling errors and asynchronous operations gracefully. While they serve distinct purposes, they can sometimes seem intertwined. Here's a breakdown to clarify their roles and interactions:

**Error Boundaries:**
- **Purpose:** Catch JavaScript errors anywhere within a component tree and prevent the entire application from crashing.
- **How it works:** Error boundaries are special React components that implement the `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method. This method catches errors thrown by descendant components and allows the error boundary to display a fallback UI instead of the broken component.
- **Benefits:**
	- Improves user experience by preventing full application crashes due to isolated errors.
	- Provides a mechanism for logging and reporting errors for debugging purposes.
	  
	  **Suspense:**
- **Purpose:** Handles asynchronous operations (like fetching data) within components, indicating to React that the component is still loading and preventing rendering until the data is available.
- **How it works:** Suspense is a feature introduced in React 16.6 that allows components to declare themselves as potentially suspending using the `React.lazy` function or the `Suspense` component. React will then display a fallback UI (usually a loading indicator) until the suspended component resolves its data and is ready to render.
- **Benefits:**
	- Improves perceived performance by preventing components from rendering with incomplete data.
	- Simplifies handling asynchronous operations within components.
	  
	  **Relationship between Error Boundaries and Suspense:**
- Although both deal with preventing issues during rendering, they address different scenarios:
	- **Error boundaries:** Catch JavaScript errors that occur during rendering, component lifecycle methods, or event handlers.
	- **Suspense:** Handles the case where a component is waiting for asynchronous data before it can render fully.
- **Errors within `Suspense`:** If an error occurs within a component wrapped in `Suspense`, the error boundary of the nearest ancestor will catch it and display the fallback UI. This is because Suspense itself doesn't catch errors, it just indicates potential delays.
  
  **Key takeaways:**
- Use error boundaries to prevent application crashes from unexpected errors anywhere in your component tree.
- Use Suspense to indicate asynchronous operations and display loading states while data is fetched.
- Remember that error boundaries can catch errors within components wrapped in Suspense.
